    <h2 id="services">Why Choose Wound Infection Metal Roofing?

</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Durability</strong> - Metal roofing can last 40–70 years, far longer than traditional asphalt shingles. It's resistant to cracking, shrinking, and eroding and can withstand extreme weather conditions including heavy rain, snow, high winds, and even hail.



</li>
      <li><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong> - Metal roofs reflect solar radiant heat, which can reduce cooling costs by up to 25%. With proper insulation, they’re also effective in colder climates.



</li>
      <li><strong>Low Maintenance</strong> - Unlike other roofing materials that may require frequent repairs, metal roofing needs minimal upkeep over its lifetime.


</li>
      <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly
</strong> - Most <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=6775627178527142273">metal roofing materials</a>
are made from recycled content and are fully recyclable at the end of their life cycle, making them a sustainable option.


 </li>
    </ul>

</h2>
    <p>Certainly! Based on your input, it seems you're looking for a paragraph comparing metal roofing and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=6775627178527142273">roofing shingles</a>
possibly using the metaphor of "wound infection" to highlight how shingles can deteriorate or fail over time — similar to a wound becoming infected — while metal roofing remains strong and resistant.

    <p>Just like a wound left untreated can lead to infection, roofing shingles that suffer from cracks, moisture retention, or mold growth can gradually deteriorate and compromise the entire roofing system.</p>
